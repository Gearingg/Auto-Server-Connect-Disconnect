Here's how you can write the points effectively in a README file:

[Important Notes]
Make sure to read and understand the following before using the bot:

1) Display Settings Scale: The coordinates you enter may not work correctly if the scale in your display settings is set to something other than 100%.

2) Window Detection Issue: If the detected window is incorrect, do not attempt to change the value on your own. Instead, delete the config.txt and window_title.txt files, and run the bot again. This will help ensure that the bot works properly.

3) Window Title Detection: Although it is not currently necessary, future updates to the bot will allow it to work in the background. At that point, window title detection will become important.

Be sure to keep these points in mind to ensure that the bot works as intended. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to reach out to the support team for assistance.
